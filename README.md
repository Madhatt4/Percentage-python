# Test Application

## Overview
The Test application is a command-line Python application for calculating the percentage of a number. This is a simple standalone tool that performs a non-interactive computation and exits after delivering the result of the calculation.

## Technology Stack
* Python - The entire application is written in Python and will be run as a Python script.

## Current State of the Project
The application contains a main Python script (`main.py`) that sets up a few test cases and outputs the results of the computations to the console.

## Project Files
The key files for the 'test' application currently implemented are:

* `/main.py` - The entry point of our application. It defines test cases and makes use of the `calculate_percentage` function.
* `/calculator.py` - Contains the `calculate_percentage` function which is responsible for performing the percentage calculations.

## Usage
To use the 'test' application, navigate to the directory containing `main.py` and run the script using the Python interpreter: `python main.py`. The script will automatically perform the calculations defined in the `test_cases` within `main.py` and print the results to the console.
